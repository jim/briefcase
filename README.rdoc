This will be a tool to facilitate keeping dotfiles in git, including those with private information (such as .gitconfig).

It is NOT yet ready for actual use.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== Changelog

0.1.3 The sync command no longer creates symlinks for dynamic files
